  <p class="chapter-1-content">
    I've loved dancing for as long as I can remember. Movement is a huge part of who I am—it’s woven into my personality and values. Naturally, my love for dance goes hand in hand with my love for music. I’m constantly searching for new songs and artists, and when a song truly resonates, it inspires me to move.<br>

    Recently, my sister asked how I knew I was a good dancer. I joked that no one ever told me I was bad, so I just kept going. But in reflecting on it, I’ve realized what might seem like raw talent is actually years of practice—practice that often doesn’t look like practice. I watch tutorials to learn tricky moves and can spend hours perfecting a choreography until it feels just right. <br>

    Unfortunately, I don’t have any childhood photos or videos of me dancing (immigrant life!), but here’s a picture of me at about four years old—probably already dancing in spirit.</p>

    A few years later, school became my priority, and dance took a backseat. Although people often said I was a good dancer, I never saw it as a serious path. When asked what I wanted to be, I’d say a doctor or pilot—dancer didn’t feel like an acceptable answer. <br>

    In 2020, during the pandemic, TikTok exploded in popularity. One of my favorite memories from that time was spending hours learning and creating “cringe” TikTok dances with friends. We’d compile lists of routines, share them, and spend the entire day making video we’d never post. Though most of the videos never left my drafts, I still revisit them for nostalgia. <br>

    TikTok also pushed me to explore new styles. Afro dance, my go-to, wasn’t widely represented on the platform, so I started learning hip-hop and Dubsmash-style routines. Along the way, I discovered music and artists I might’ve missed, including the iconic Saucy Santana dance, which somehow works with every song.</p>

  <p>
    During my first year of university, I joined an Afro dance club called AfroxDance, and it truly saved me. I was stuck in a program that didn’t suit me, struggling with every class, and failing nearly every quiz. On top of that, family issues during that season made it feel like everything was falling apart. I was deeply depressed and anxious, unsure of how to move forward. Those two hours of weekly practice with the team became my sanctuary. Learning dances, creating formations, and spending time with my girls were the highlights of my week, especially during a harsh winter. </p>
    
    <p>AfroxDance also challenged me as a dancer. After years of focusing on short TikTok routines, I had to step up and master full-body choreography. It was during this time that dancing became a part of my identity. People would approach me after performances, and some even invited AfroxDance to perform at their events.</p>
    
    <p>Joining AfroxDance was a turning point. It reminded me that dance is not just about movement but about community and connection. It improved both my mental health and physical fitness—fueling my growth as a dancer. Though I’m no longer part of the club due to academic demands, I hope to return someday. AfroxDance was a wonderful community, and I encourage everyone to check them out—they’re doing amazing things.</p>

  <p>Though I’ve taken a break from AfroxDance, I haven’t stopped dancing. Over the past year, I’ve been taking drop-in classes at The Studio North in Toronto with some friends from AfroxDance. It was refreshing to be surrounded by people who shared the same love for dance, and some who were even better than me. The challenge was tough but incredibly fulfilling. In the coming year, I plan to take more classes and track my progress. I also want to focus more on my health to become the best version of myself. I’m not aiming to be discovered or become a professional dancer—my goal is simply to be better than I was. I also want to explore other styles, like salsa and hip-hop, and make dance a bigger part of my lifestyle rather than just a hidden hobby. Ultimately, I hope to return to AfroxDance and give back to the community, helping others the way it helped me.
