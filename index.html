  <h3>The one where I joined AfroxDance</h3>
  <p>
    During my first year of university, I joined an Afro dance club called AfroxDance, and it truly saved me. I was stuck in a program that didn’t suit me, struggling with every class, and failing nearly every quiz. On top of that, family issues during that season made it feel like everything was falling apart. I was deeply depressed and anxious, unsure of how to move forward.

    Those two hours of weekly practice with the team became my sanctuary. Learning dances, creating formations, and spending time with my girls were the highlights of my week, especially during a harsh winter. 

    AfroxDance also challenged me as a dancer. After years of focusing on short TikTok routines, I had to step up and master full-body choreography. It was during this time that I started being recognized as a dancer. People would approach me after performances, and some even invited AfroxDance to perform at their events.

    Joining AfroxDance was a turning point. It reminded me that dance is not just about movement but about community and connection. It improved both my mental health and physical fitness—fueling my growth as a dancer.

    Though I’m no longer part of the club due to academic demands, I hope to return someday. AfroxDance was a wonderful community, and I encourage everyone to check them out—they’re doing amazing things.</p>
